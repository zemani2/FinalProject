## üìö Project Description
The "AI-Enhanced Anomaly Detection for Children" project focuses on improving children's mental health by using wearable technology and machine learning to detect physiological anomalies correlated with stress and anxiety. The system primarily uses heart rate variability (HRV), sleep patterns, and behavioral data from smartwatches to identify potential anxiety-inducing events. It provides timely alerts to parents through a mobile application, allowing for personalized interventions that can improve a child's well-being.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Anxiety Detection:** Tracks physiological data in real-time to identify abnormal stress levels.
- **Parental Alerts:** Sends instant notifications to parents when anomalies suggest a potential stress or anxiety event.
- **Customizable Reports:** Provides detailed reports on children‚Äôs stress-related metrics, such as sleep disturbances and time spent in vehicles.
- **User-friendly Android Interface:** Designed for ease of use, the mobile app helps parents stay informed and manage their child's health proactively.
- **Personalized Monitoring:** Adapts to each child‚Äôs unique physiological data, improving the accuracy of anomaly detection.

## Components
- **Smartwatch Sensors**: Utilizes sensors such as heart rate monitors for real-time physiological data collection.
- **AI Algorithms**: Processes collected data to detect patterns indicative of stress or anxiety episodes.
- **Parental Interface**: Mobile application interface for parental alerts and access to insights into their child's mental health.
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: Infrastructure for storing and analyzing heart rate data to generate actionable insights.
- **Communication Module**: Facilitates seamless communication between the smartwatch, AI algorithms, and parental interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Smartwatch Technology**: Existing smartwatch hardware with integrated sensors for data collection.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Advanced algorithms for processing and analyzing heart rate data to detect patterns indicative of anxiety.
- **Mobile Application Development**: Development of a user-friendly mobile application for parental alerts and insights.
- **Cloud Computing**: Infrastructure for data storage, analysis, and communication between components.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques to improve the accuracy of anxiety detection algorithms over time.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### üß± Prerequisites
Smartwatch: Garmin wearables (or similar devices) for real-time data collection.
Mobile Device: Android smartphone for running the mobile app.

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### üèóÔ∏è Installing
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/zemani2/FinalProject.git
Install dependencies: Run ./gradlew build in the Android Studio environment.
Connect Firebase: Set up a Firebase project for real-time database management.
Deploy the app: Install the APK on an Android device for testing.


A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## üß™ Testing
To test the anomaly detection model and app functionality:

Simulate data inputs: Use Garmin devices to collect HRV and other physiological metrics.
Trigger anomalies: Create scenarios with abnormal data patterns (e.g., disrupted sleep).
Verify alerts: Check that the app sends alerts when significant stress indicators are detected.

### Sample Tests
Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

## üöÄ Deployment
For live deployment:
Connect the app to live Garmin watch data.
Monitor real-time feedback through the app.
Deploy updates using Firebase for seamless updates to the backend and user interface.
